1. Supports linking into network
2. Show the current hierarchy of neural networks
3. Lifetime of neuron support
4. Automatically adds neuron, and fade out useless ones
5. Manual tuning of network
6. Network visualization
   QuickQanava seems to be a starting point
7. Supports CUDA/OpenCL/FPGA, which work as computing node, just like CPU
   different kind of nodes can co-exist, is data that flows
8. source level plugin also flows among nodes, if tested enough
   these pluins may offer new neuron type, new connection type, etc.
